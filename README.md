# HackRX2024

For HackRX 2024, I took responsibilty for the front-end of an application to help pharmacists better serve patients. 

When a required drug is unavailable at a pharmacy for a patient, the pharmacist has to call up a nearby pharmacy, and manually collect the drug. 
This process is very inefficient, and something we knew could be easily optimized through a couple (maybe a bit more ;)) lines of code. Since most pharmacists use Kroll in Canada, our application intends to be an add on.
It accesses the inventory of drugs, and prescription needs, to forecast drug needs for a more appropriate weekly drug restocking. 
Moreover, when a drug is in immediate need, this application offloads the work of contacting and negotiating with another pharmacy from the pharmacist by utilizing AI calling.

As the network of pharmacies grow that use this application, it can easily be enhanced to eliminate the need for AI calling, and instead communicate from application to application for a more streamlined system.
